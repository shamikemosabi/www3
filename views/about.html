			<strong>12/25/15</strong> - Now you can upvote or downvote on hits!

			Click the + sign to add comments for each individual hits

			<strong>12/18/15</strong> - Go to settings now for more sounds and volume settings! I got most of the sound files from <a href="http://soundbible.com/">http://soundbible.com/</a>  
			</br></br>
				If you have a sound you think would fit, feel free to send it to me and if I like it I may add it.
				</br></br>
				Also if you notice the site has not been fetching any hits, please refresh the webpage, if the last updated on date is still an old date
				please contact me and I will fix it.

		<li class="tab-item2 list-divider">	
			<strong>11/16/15 </strong>- I'm now paying my host to remove the pop up ads they added to my page, 
			For those of you that are still getting pop up ads, please clear your cache. There will still be ads on the right side which are mine, 
			feel free to click them as much as you like :)</br>
			And for those who have ad block on, I'm okay with that I just need enough to pay for host and domain name.
			</br></br></br>
				
		 </li>

		 
		<li class="tab-item2 list-divider">	
			<strong>11/3/15</strong> - Added sound when there is new hit, go to setting page to turn it on or off.</br></br></br>
				
		 </li>
		 <li class="tab-item2 list-divider">	
			<strong>9/14/15</strong> - New host isn't too good. Web scrapper would crash while FTPing randomly. This is why site has been randomly fetching nothing.</br>
					- I'm afraid I have to go back to the other host. </br>
						Ads are going to be annoying but you guys don't really need to be refreshing the page.
						So the popup is a one time thing </br></br>
				
		 </li>

		<li class="tab-item2 list-divider">			
				<strong>9/6/15</strong> - I noticed my host was adding popup ads on my site. Changed to another web host. </br>
					- added my own google ads </br></br>					
		 </li>
		 <li class="tab-item2 list-divider">			
			- Added ability to delete individual hits </br>
				- Added Preview and Accept links </br>
				- Now scraps mturkforum and mturkgrind </br>

		  <li class="tab-item2">Don't need to refresh the page, just leave browser on the main page.<br><br>
				This website will periodically fetch hits that are posted on Mturkforum.com <br><br>
				Use the Clear button to clear the screen, to manage the hits you have already done <br><br><br><br>
